          question: "What's the difference between pavers, flagstone, and stamped concrete?",
          answer:
            "Pavers are manufactured units (concrete or clay) that offer consistent size and color with easy repair options. Flagstone is natural stone with unique patterns and colors but irregular shapes. Stamped concrete is poured concrete textured to mimic stone or brick, offering a seamless surface at a lower cost. Each has different maintenance requirements, costs, and aesthetic qualities.",
        },
        {
          question: "How do you ensure proper drainage for patios and walkways?",
          answer:
            "Proper drainage is critical for any hardscape project. We ensure adequate slope away from structures (typically 1/4 inch per foot), install appropriate base materials, and may incorporate drainage systems like French drains or permeable materials when needed. Our site evaluation identifies potential drainage issues before installation begins.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you install patios and walkways in winter?",
          answer:
            "Installation is weather-dependent. We can work in cool weather, but avoid installation during freezing conditions or when the ground is frozen. Concrete work requires temperatures above 40Â°F. The best seasons are spring through fall when ground conditions are stable and temperatures are moderate.",
        },
        {
          question: "How long will my new patio or walkway last?",
          answer:
            "With proper installation and maintenance, patios and walkways can last decades. Pavers typically last 25+ years, natural stone can last 50+ years, and concrete 20-30 years. Longevity depends on material quality, installation techniques, local climate, and maintenance. We provide care instructions to maximize the life of your investment.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you create complex patio designs with multiple materials and patterns?",
          answer:
            "We specialize in comprehensive patio designs that incorporate multiple paver patterns, different materials, integrated features like fire pits and seating walls, and decorative elements like dry creek beds. Our design team can create detailed plans showing how all elements work together harmoniously.",
