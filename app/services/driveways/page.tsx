          question: "What driveway material is most durable?",
          answer:
            "All materials we offer (concrete, asphalt, and pavers) are durable when properly installed. Concrete typically lasts 30+ years, asphalt 15-20 years with maintenance, and pavers 25+ years with the advantage of being repairable in sections if needed. The best choice depends on your budget, aesthetic preferences, climate, and maintenance preferences.",
        },
        {
          question: "How long will it take to install my new driveway?",
          answer:
            "Installation time varies based on size, design complexity, and materials. A typical residential driveway replacement takes 3-7 days from demolition to completion. Concrete driveways require additional curing time of 7-10 days before they can be used. We'll provide a specific timeline for your project during the proposal phase.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you install a driveway in winter?",
          answer:
            "Installation during freezing temperatures is not recommended for most driveway materials. Concrete shouldn't be installed when temperatures are below 40Â°F, and asphalt requires warm temperatures for proper compaction. The ideal seasons for driveway installation are spring, summer, and fall when temperatures are moderate.",
        },
        {
          question: "What maintenance will my new driveway require?",
          answer:
            "Maintenance requirements vary by material. Concrete needs periodic cleaning and sealing every 2-3 years. Asphalt should be seal-coated every 2-5 years and may need minor repairs over time. Paver driveways require occasional joint sand replenishment and may need periodic sealing depending on the product. We provide detailed maintenance instructions for your specific driveway.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you incorporate drainage solutions into my driveway design?",
          answer:
            "Yes, proper drainage is a critical component of any driveway project. We can incorporate various drainage solutions including proper sloping away from structures, channel drains, catch basins, or permeable paving options. During our site evaluation, we'll assess your specific drainage needs and recommend appropriate solutions.",
