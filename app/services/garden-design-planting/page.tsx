            "Our first step is always a detailed conversation to understand your preferences â€“ whether you love a modern, minimalist look, a lush Southern garden, a formal English style, or a relaxed beachy vibe. We then combine this with your home's architecture and site conditions to create something uniquely yours.",

          question: "How long does the landscape design process take?",
          answer:
            "The design phase duration varies based on project complexity and client responsiveness. It can range from a few days for simple plans to several weeks for extensive designs. Installation lead times also vary, typically from a few weeks to a couple of months depending on our schedule.",

          question: "Do you use 3D design software?",
          answer:
            "Yes, we have 3D design software with CAD capabilities that allows us to create detailed visualizations, including a library of plants, so you can see a virtual representation of your future landscape. This helps in making informed decisions.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why is post-installation maintenance important?",
          answer:
            "A new landscape needs careful attention to establish. We prefer to manage the ongoing maintenance (irrigation adjustments, plant health checks, lighting tweaks) to ensure everything thrives as intended. While we provide care guides if you self-maintain, we cannot offer the same guarantees as when we manage the aftercare.",
